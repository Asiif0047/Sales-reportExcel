### Project Overview
 #### Project Title:  Excel Data Cleaning and Interactive Dashboard Creation for Bike Buyers


##### Project Objective
The primary goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize bike buyer data to identify key factors influencing purchase decisions. The dashboard will provide actionable insights to understand customer demographics, income levels, and other relevant metrics.


##### Dataset Description: 
The dataset includes demographic information, income, family details, occupation, region, and purchase history related to bike buyers.

##### Key Steps in the Project
###### Data Import & Initial Review:

Imported the raw dataset into Excel.
Reviewed the data to identify any immediate issues or inconsistencies.

###### Data Cleaning (Excel):

Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

Text Standardization: Standardized text fields, such as marital status and gender, for consistency and better readability. Replaced 'M' with "Married", 'S' with "Single", 'M' with "Male" and 'F' with "Female". Fixed typo "marital styles" with "Marital Status"

Data Formatting: Ensured that currency values were appropriately formatted.

Age Bracketing: Created age brackets to group ages into meaningful categories for analysis.

###### Pivot Table Creation:

Dragged and dropped relevant fields into the Rows, Columns, and Values areas to create meaningful summaries.
Added filters to the pivot table to enable dynamic data exploration.

###### Dashboard Development (Excel):

Average Income Analysis: Analyzed the average income of bike buyers versus non-buyers based on gender.

Data Visualization: Created charts and graphs to visualize key trends and insights.

Interactive Filters: Implemented filters to allow users to explore the data based on various criteria.

###### Dashboard
The dashboard includes visualizations for average income per purchase, broken down by gender and purchase status.
Slicers allow users to filter data dynamically.


###### Project Insights

People with slightly higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes.
Average incomes for males are higher than females, regardless of whether they purchased a bike.
